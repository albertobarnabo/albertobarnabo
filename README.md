**Computer Science Engineer**

I am a trilingual computer science engineer from Italy. I obtaine my bachelor's degree in 2021 at Politecnico di Milano. Subsequently, I started my master's degree and got accepted into a very selective double degree program at Xi'an Jiaotong University. My last year there I worked as a university researcher, studdying LLMs and their ability to parse tabular data.
I graduated in China on June 2024 and in Politecnico on October of the same year with a score of 105/110.

I currently work as a software engineer in Capgemini, in Milan.
